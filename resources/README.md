# FHIR Bundle Calculation Resources
The following example  calculations assume there is a cqf-ruler instance running locally. This can be achieved by running:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 contentgroup/cqf-ruler
```
## EXM_130
The following calculation command assumes that
1. `resources/EXM_130/EXM_130_bundle.json` measure bundle has been posted to the local cqf-ruler instance
2. The required value sets are available on the local cqf-ruler instance. A value set bundle for value sets used in this measure can be obtained [here](https://github.com/DBCG/connectathon/blob/master/resources/fhir3/valuesets/valuesets-bundle-exm130-FHIR.json)

The example patients in this example were generated by running the command. `./run_synthea -p 200 -m "EXM130*" -a 51-51` in the [synthea repository](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea) The age range `51-51` was used in order to maximize the probability that a patient over 50 would have an encounter added in 2019. If you want more age variability in your output change what is passed in using the `-a` arguement just note that you will have less patients that are relevant to EXM 130.
```bash
node src/cli.js -d ./resources/EXM_130/patients -c ./resources/EXM_130/EXM130_FHIR3.cql -u http://localhost:8080/cqf-ruler-dstu3/fhir
```
